python
Copy code
finish_time = st.sidebar.text_input("End time")

if finish_time:
    # Specify the timezone
    timezone = pytz.timezone('Australia/Sydney')
    # Get the current time
    now = datetime.now(timezone)
    current_time = now.time()
    # Define the time to compare (example: 3:30 PM)
    end_time = datetime.strptime(finish_time, '%H:%M').time()
    # Check if compare_time is earlier than the current time
    if end_time > current_time:
        time.sleep(5)
        st.rerun()
